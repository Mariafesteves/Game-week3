# Project 1 - Space Rabbit

<p align="justify">
Space Rabbit is a browser-based game built using JavaScript classes and DOM manipulation. Guide the rabbit through incoming eggs (obstacles) moving from right to left. As time passes, the speed of the obstacles increases, making the game more challenging. The longer you survive without colliding, the higher your score climbs.

## How to play

1. Press Spacebar to make the rabbit jump.

2. Dodge the incoming egg obstacles that move from right to left.

3. The longer you survive, the faster the eggs come.

4. Each second you stay alive increases your score.

5. If the rabbit collides with an egg, it's Game Over.

6. Click "Restart" on the Game Over screen to try again!
